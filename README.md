RedMinecraft
=========

RedMinecraft is a fork of the well-known [Waterfall](https://github.com/PaperMC/Waterfall) server teleportation suite.

RedMinecraft focuses on simple usage. We provide simple but useful and powerful plugin manager.

## Why fork Waterfall?

Think of RedMinecraft as a principles fork.

RedMinecraft was forked because of the fact that upstream does not accept many contributions that are intended to better the ecosystem. Simply put, RedMinecraft aims to better
the ecosystem by allowing changes to be exposed to a wider audience more quickly.

RedMinecraft will still track upstream Waterfall and merge changes as needed.
